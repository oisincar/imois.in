* Privacy Policy
Last updated: April 11, 2023

Look... It's just [[https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites][google analytics]]. It's only initialised if you choose to accept cookies. No personally identifying information is stored by me, or accessed by me.

In addition, travle and wordle-squared each store a cookie which is used to keep track of your current streak and other past stats, as well as any ongoing game. As this is necessary for their function, (and isn't used to identify or track anyone) this is always enabled.

Don't sue me plz, ty!
