* About Me
I'm Ois√≠n,

I'm a recent graduate of a Masters in Computer Engineering in Trinity College,
Dublin. A longtime hobbyist game-developer, juggler, and machine learning enthusiast, recently I've
been trying to up my pure-maths skills, too. I now work part time as a researcher at the Adapt Center,
while balancing up some other projects on the side!

This site collects random projects I've been working on in my spare time.

Other bits I've worked on/am working on include:
- [[http://siliconsynapse.net/][*Silicone Synapse*]]: A VR exhibit with artist AlanJames Burns.
- [[https://syze.ai/][*Syze.ai*]]: An AI-based startup aiming to reduce returns for online clothing stores.
- [[https://www.facebook.com/WizardLizardGame/][*WizardLizard*]]: A 3d puzzle game based on illusions, featuring a procedural lizard.

[[../misc/resume.pdf][My CV]] is a bit outdated now but might be interesting!

sharing my name/background on linkedin but they're not me(!)
