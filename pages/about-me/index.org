* About Me
Hi, I'm Oisin,

Right now, I'm a Masters Computer Engineering student in Trinity College,
Dublin. A longtime hobbyist gamedeveloper, juggler, and machine learning enthusiast, recently I've
been trying to up my pure-maths skills, too.

This site collects random projects I've been working on in my spare time.

Other bits I've worked on/am working on include:
- [[http://siliconsynapse.net/][*Silicone Synapse*]]: A VR exhibit with artist AlanJames Burns.
- [[https://syze.ai/][*Syze.ai*]]: An AI-based startup aiming to reduce returns for online clothing stores.
- [[https://www.facebook.com/WizardLizardGame/][*WizardLizard*]]: A 3d puzzle game based on illusions, featuring a procedural lizard.
- [[https://github.com/oisincar/cnp-5][*CNP*]]: An old maths problem that is the subject of a recent [[http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Hadwiger-Nelson_problem][polymath project]].

[[../misc/resume.pdf][My CV]] is a bit outdated now but might be interesting!

sharing my name/ background on linkedin but they're not me(!)
