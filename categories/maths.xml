&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf831e36"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This game was sent to me by Lucy Deacon (Link to be added :P), who found it in &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=name.boyle.chris.sgtpuzzles&amp;amp;hl=en_IE"&gt;Simon Tatham's Puzzles&lt;/a&gt;
under the name 'Flip' around August of 2018. For the few months thereafter
we went down the rabbit-hole on how to solve the game, when it's solvable, and
wrote some fast programs and algorithms to check the properties of some very big
boards. This post contains some of the stuff we managed to work out!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgb26dadd" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgb26dadd"&gt;The Game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb26dadd"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://imois.in/assets/js/TouchUtils.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script src="https://imois.in/assets/js/lights_out/utils.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script src="https://imois.in/assets/js/lights_out/LightsCanvas.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script src="https://imois.in/assets/js/lights_out/LightsOut.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script src="https://imois.in/assets/js/lights_out/LightsOutState.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span class="underline"&gt;Lights Out&lt;/span&gt; is a game released by Tiger
Electronics in 1995. You're given a 5x5 grid of lights, some illuminated and
some not, and your task is to turn them all off. The problem is that toggling
each light also toggles all the surrounding lights…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, we didn't know the game had a name, much less a Wikipedia
article, until we'd finished…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've made a little version of it here… The game works equally well (or does
it!!) on different board sizes. Try to turn all 'lights' off.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Arm --&gt;
    &lt;canvas id="lights-out0" class="light_border" width="400" height="300" style="max-width: 85vw;"&gt;
        Your browser doesn't support html5 canvas :c.
    &lt;/canvas&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="figure-number"&gt;Game 1:&lt;/span&gt; The game of Lights-Out in it's original size: 5x5. Click to flip the blue 'lights'! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
var g = new LightsOut(document.getElementById('lights-out0'), 5, 5);
g.randomize();
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The question is… How can you solve it? Is there a way to look at a position
and instantly know how to solve it or even if can be solved at all?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org29b9e52" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org29b9e52"&gt;Impossible boards?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org29b9e52"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First of all, not all boards are solvable. A 2x1 board, for example, will never
let you click on only a single tile. If it starts with just one light on,
there's never a way to turn it off… However, is the same true for bigger boards?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Arm --&gt;
    &lt;canvas id="lights-out2x1" class="light_border" width="400" height="300" style="max-width: 85vw;"&gt;
        Your browser doesn't support html5 canvas :c.
    &lt;/canvas&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="figure-number"&gt;Game 2:&lt;/span&gt; A simple 'parity' case for lights-out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
var g = new LightsOut(document.getElementById('lights-out2x1'), 2, 1, maxwidth=300, parity=true);
g.randomize();
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;
All other boards in this page are solvable though… So don't worry :P
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org4ad207a" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org4ad207a"&gt;State&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4ad207a"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first thing to notice is that tapping on the same square twice is the same
as not tapping at all, and also that the order you tap the squares doesn't make
a difference. The solution then will never require pressing any square more than
once - and since we don't care about order, we can store just a yes or no for
whether we need to toggle that square.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's the same game board (in blue, below), but also the solution for it; the
red squares are the ones to tap to solve the board.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Arm --&gt;
    &lt;canvas id="lights-out-state0" class="light_border" width="400" height="300" style="max-width: 85vw;"&gt;
        Your browser doesn't support html5 canvas :c.
    &lt;/canvas&gt;&lt;canvas id="lights-out-game0" class="light_border" width="400" height="300" style="max-width: 85vw;"&gt;
        Your browser doesn't support html5 canvas :c.
    &lt;/canvas&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="figure-number"&gt;Game 3:&lt;/span&gt; The corresponding hidden 'state'/solution (red) for the game board (blue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
var g = new LightsOutState(document.getElementById('lights-out-state0'),
                           document.getElementById('lights-out-game0'),
                           5, 5);
g.randomize();
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If we could work out the corresponding red board for a new unseen blue one…
We'd be able to solve the game.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org9cf34fc" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org9cf34fc"&gt;Forward mapping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9cf34fc"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's not too hard to do the reverse: I.e. take the tapped squares (red) and work out the
corresponding board position. There's also only one mapping from this red
'solution' board to the blue 'game' board: A light will be on if and only if
it's surrounded by an odd number of 'taps'.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In fact, it's possible to represent this as matrix multiplication. If the
board is \(m \times n\), we can write the board-state as a single vector \(\vec{b}\) with \(m*n\)
elements. Each element is 1 if the corresponding light is on and 0 otherwise.
The taps on each square - i.e. the solution for that board can be written similarly as
\(\vec{t}\).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
\[ \vec{b} = M\vec{t} \pmod 2 \]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We can also consider the whole problem over a binary field - so that all
arithmetic is carried out modulo 2 anyway.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This matrix \(M\) is a kind of strange 'thick' diagonal matrix. For a 3x3 board it
looks like this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
\[
M_{3\times3} = \begin{Bmatrix}
1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\
1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\
0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\
1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\
0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\
0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 \\
0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\
0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 \\
0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 \\
\end{Bmatrix}
\]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In order to find a solution for our board, we can find the inverse of this
matrix (if it exists!) and solve the equation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
\[ \vec{t} = M^{-1}\vec{b} \]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If an inverse exists, then for that board there is exactly one solution
corresponding to every board state - and all board states are solvable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org953d243" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org953d243"&gt;Unsolvable boards?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org953d243"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If there is an unsolvable configuration of the board, i.e. a board state which
has no taps that leaves all the lights off, then it must exist in the null space
of this matrix. A board is completely solvable iff the matrix has no null space.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hacking out some very bad row-echelon reduction we could graph the nullity of
these matrices for different size boards, this shows which sizes of board are
always solvable, and which have many configurations that make them unsolvable.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://imois.in/images/lights_out/graph20.png" alt="graph20.png" width="500px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="figure-number"&gt;Figure 1: &lt;/span&gt;What board sizes are solvable? If a boardsize is solvable completely, it's corresponding square in coloured black. A board which is 'as unsolvable' as it's possible to be is white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We can see from this that as expected a \(1\times1\) board is always solvable, but
interestingly a \(4\times 4\) is not. There's also interesting patterns forming
already… It looks very regular, and there are lines forming for \(11\times n\)
boards too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org1370ae5" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org1370ae5"&gt;Nullity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1370ae5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's interesting to mess around with one of the boards with maximum nullity.
Here's a 4x4 board. It's far easier than others because if there is a solution
at all for a position, then there are many.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Arm --&gt;
    &lt;canvas id="lights-out4x4" class="light_border" width="400" height="300" style="max-width: 85vw;"&gt;
        Your browser doesn't support html5 canvas :c.
    &lt;/canvas&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="figure-number"&gt;Game 4:&lt;/span&gt; A 4x4 board has the maximum nullity, making it much easier to solve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
var g = new LightsOut(document.getElementById('lights-out4x4'), 4, 4);
g.randomize();
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Similar to a Rubik's cube, where flipping a single piece makes the puzzle
unsolvable, lights-out boards of many dimensions have similar 'parity' cases.
The nullity of the mapping matrix effectively counts these. For a \(4\times 4\)
board, which has a nullity of 4, there are 4 pieces which are fully determined
by the remaining 12. Also, for every solvable board, there are \(2^4 -1\)
unsolvable ones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org39f2fa8" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org39f2fa8"&gt;'Cascading'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org39f2fa8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One (human) way of trying to solve a lights-out puzzle is to always try to
click under any light. If you go through the board row-by-row downwards,
and always click below any 'on' lights, you can take any game state and 'cascade'
all remaining lights into the bottom row.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At this point, you can click a few times in the top row, and repeat the process.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Clicking just
one square in the top row and cascading it to the bottom will cause some of the
squares in the bottom row to flip. This means that each square in the top row corresponds (after
cascade) to some subset of the bottom row being flipped. If we work out what
these correspondences are, we have another way of solving the board.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Arm --&gt;
    &lt;canvas id="lights-out-cascade" class="light_border" width="400" height="300" style="max-width: 85vw;"&gt;
        Your browser doesn't support html5 canvas :c.
    &lt;/canvas&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="figure-number"&gt;Game 5:&lt;/span&gt; An animation of cascading. Pick a random square in the top row, then 'cascade' it downwards. Eventually, this will solve the board!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
var g = new LightsOut(document.getElementById('lights-out-cascade'), 4, 6);

function setupCascade(g, delay) {
    // Add timer to perform cascade...
    window.setInterval(function(){
        // Find highest point under
        var found = false;
        var j = 1, i = 0;
        for (j; j &lt; g.squaresY; j++) {
            for (i=0; i &lt; g.squaresX; i++) {
                // If there's a square above it, we've found where to click.
                if (g.squares[i + (j-1)*g.squaresX] == 1) {
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (found) break;
        }

        // If we haven't found one, just click anywhere in the top row.
        if (!found) {
            j = 0;
            i = Math.floor(Math.random() * g.squaresX);
        }

        // Click that square
        g.click(i,j);
    }, delay); // 1000ms = 1 sec
}

setupCascade(g, 1000);
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since it's possible to always reduce any board (via cascade) to having lights
only in the bottom row, another way to ask if a boardsize is solvable if it's
possible to reach &lt;span class="underline"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt; bottom row configuration by click/cascading. This is
true because cascades commute.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If we construct a matrix from the resulting bottom rows of all possible
click-a-square/cascade ops, it will span all solvable bottom rows.
Then, the boardsize will always be solvable iff that matrix has a nullity of 0.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is far more efficient than our previous method. Since we can equally
perform cascading left-to-right as well as downwards the matrices we need to
check are only
\(min(m,n)\times min(m,n)\) rather than \(mn \times mn\) as before.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's interesting that a 4x4 board is always solvable in one try via cascading,
since it's nullity spans the entire bottom row.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Arm --&gt;
    &lt;canvas id="lights-out-cascade-big" class="light_border" width="400" height="300" style="max-width: 85vw;"&gt;
        Your browser doesn't support html5 canvas :c.
    &lt;/canvas&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="figure-number"&gt;Game 6:&lt;/span&gt; For fun, here's a very large game cascading. Note the patterns left in the last row. We're interested if it's possible to construct any pattern here by click/cascading any number of times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
var h = new LightsOut(document.getElementById('lights-out-cascade-big'), 20, 20, maxwidth=450);
setupCascade(h, 100);
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgc67c5d8" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgc67c5d8"&gt;Maximum nullity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc67c5d8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An interesting result from this is there is a maximum nullity for any board.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Namely, since we can cascade any board into a single row, the nullity
of the mapping between solution and boardstate cannot be larger than \(m\). Also,
we can equally perform the cascade left-to-right, giving an upper bound of \(min(m,n)\).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This can also be proven by looking at the structure of our original mapping matrix \(M\).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
\[
M_{3\times3} = \begin{Bmatrix}
1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\
1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\
0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\
{ \color{red}1 } &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\
0 &amp;amp; { \color{red}1 } &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\
0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; { \color{red}1 } &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 \\
0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; { \color{red}1 } &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\
0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; { \color{red}1 } &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 \\
0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; { \color{red}1 } &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 \\
\end{Bmatrix}
\]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This diagonal (shown in red) will always run from \((0,m)\) to \((n*(m-1), mn)\),
and can be used to construct the first \(n*(m-1)\) columns of a matrix in row-echelon
form. The maximum nullity of this matrix therefore is \(n\). Similarly to before,
the board can be rotated prior to constructing the matrix, and so the maximum
nullity is \(min(m,n)\).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgcd0f517" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgcd0f517"&gt;Bitops&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcd0f517"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In order to speed up calculating large boards, we wrote some Very Fast&lt;sup&gt;tm&lt;/sup&gt; c++
matrix code, to perform all binary field arithmetic in parallel with bitops.
The vectors, as well as matrix rows are encoded as several unsigned
integers, each storing 32 binary values. Multiplication can then simply be performed
using xor. Similarly row-echelon reduction and calculation of the rank/nullity
of each matrix can be done extremely quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The cascade operation can also be treated with bit-ops. We take
the current highest non-zero row. This is the row we need to 'click under', so
to speak, and denote it as the top row. We take the row below it (the middle row) and xor
it in-place with the top row. This forms the center of the cross.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Next, we can xor the middle row once again with the top row bitshifted once
left, and once right (being careful to handle overlaps), forming the left/right
arms of the cross. We can then xor the row further below (the bottom
row) in-place with the top row, forming the base of the cross. Finally the top
row can be set to 0s, which is effectively the top of the cross.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This allows us to perform up to 32 'clicks' at once, in very few bit operations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org625e079" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org625e079"&gt;Low memory cascade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org625e079"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although this cascade is fast, it requires a lot of memory. In order to generate
the matrix for, e.g. a \(4000 \times 4000\) board, it requires 4000 boards, or the
same board to be used 4000 times. This is getting very large!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If we consider click-cascading only on an empty board, we only ever have 3 rows with
non-zero entries at a time. We can perform the operation only with 3 rows,
shuffling them around on each iteration.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We can do better though. With the bottom row starting empty, it really just
becomes set equal to the top row. This means we can store just 2 rows, and
treat them as top/middle. We can perform each cascade iteration with 3 xors and
two bitshifts for up to 32 clicks. It's also close in memory which should reduce
cache misses.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All in all, this sped up our program by from taking almost
20 hours to calculate all boards up to \(512\times 512\) to just 12 seconds. It's
6000 times faster, without parallelization. The speedup is even more significant
vs the pre-cascading programs and our initial python/numpy code too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org9fa13b8" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org9fa13b8"&gt;Lots of boards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9fa13b8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In order to calculate nullity for a few million boards… We could compute
the matrices for all boards of a certain width simultaneously. Cascade once,
grab the new bottom row for each board, copy it into a matrix, reduce it in-place
and calculate nullity, and discard it. We can then iterate to calculate the
nullity of a board that is \((m+1)\times n\). To parallelize, each core just takes a
width of board and calculates the nullity of all boards of that width up to a
maximum. This took a few days to run on a HPC cluster, even with all of our
optimizations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org8c4063e" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org8c4063e"&gt;Results!!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8c4063e"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The resulting images for different sizes.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://imois.in/images/lights_out/graph128.png" alt="graph128.png" width="500px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://imois.in/images/lights_out/graph512.png" alt="graph512.png" width="500px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://imois.in/images/lights_out/graph4096.png" alt="graph4096.png" width="500px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here we can see the patterns that continue even for very large boards. In the
512x512 image, there's a faint grid forming at near powers of 2: 127 and 255.
Above it, there's a similar line around 63. The largest size: 4096 requires
zooming for the 'constilations' to be even visible, but they're there, with
several big spots also scattered around.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's interesting that, as you move further 'out', the boards are relatively more
solvable. The intuition is that, for a board to have a very high nullity, many
it's click/cascade vectors must align. This becomes increasingly more unlikely to
happen as these vectors increase in size and number.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There're very few large boards which loose all dimensions. These are the only
ones larger than 1024*1024 (not including rotations).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col class="org-right"&gt;
&lt;col class="org-right"&gt;
&lt;col class="org-right"&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th scope="col" class="org-right"&gt;height&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th scope="col" class="org-right"&gt;width&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th scope="col" class="org-right"&gt;percentage nullity&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;1023&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;1535&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;1.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;1023&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;3071&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;1.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;1279&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;3839&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;1.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;1791&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;2303&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;1.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;2047&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;3071&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;1.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;1407&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;3967&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;0.9097370291400142&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;1535&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;3071&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="org-right"&gt;0.9993485342019544&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These are all surprisingly structured! Often near 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;-1 or 3*2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;-1 (i.e. 3071).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgdaa93d5" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgdaa93d5"&gt;Other…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdaa93d5"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org4f50768" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org4f50768"&gt;Looping patterns?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4f50768"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since a cascade operation can be written as a matrix multiplication (if the
board has width \(m\), the resulting cascade matrix is \(2m\times 2m\)), we can
consider powers of it instead of repeatedly cascading.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The question becomes, what power of this matrix results in the identity matrix
(or the same cascade matrix again)? This would mean the nullity of boards of a
certain width would form a long repeating pattern based on their height.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The period of small cascade matrices; less than 40, are all about/below 8000-16000,
but it blows up from there… The period of the cascade over a board of width 40
is over one million iterations.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Funnily, we both came up with this idea coincidentally within a few minutes of each other.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org7f0965e" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org7f0965e"&gt;Sequences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7f0965e"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some board widths are surprisingly solvable/ unsolvable. We found boards of size
(\(10 \times 31n-1\)) are all unsolvable (nullity of 10) to as high as we could
calculate at the time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Several other widths are surprisingly solvable, 10 (other than above), 81, and many more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org6c93c6d" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org6c93c6d"&gt;OEIS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6c93c6d"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences is a searchable database
containing, well, integer sequences. After finishing up, we tried searching it
for our sequence. It turns out square boards have their own entry &lt;a href="https://oeis.org/A093614"&gt;here!&lt;/a&gt; This was
the first time we knew the game by it's proper name, and found the game's
relation to other areas of cellular automata.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We'd generated almost twice as far as the furthest though! The highest term in
the OEIS sequence is 2363, while ours is ~4100.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgc6dcd4c" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgc6dcd4c"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc6dcd4c"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think we both agree we haven't completely figured out as much as we'd like…
The patterns are still somewhat a mystery, even if we've found some logic in
them! It's one to revisit for sure :P.
&lt;/p&gt;
