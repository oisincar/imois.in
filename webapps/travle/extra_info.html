            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                For <b>travle</b> 2.0 I decided to try to be much more transparent about how the game works.
                This page provides some in-depth information about the various countries, borders, connections and rules that govern <b>travle</b>.
                I don't expect the decisions here to please everyone, but I hope there is at least some consistant logic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course there will also be mistakes and bugs! And really, my knowledge of geopolitics isn't strong enough to have opinions on lots of these issues.
                I'm always happy to be corrected and/or informed - you can find me on Twitter
                <a href="https://twitter.com/onemoremoose">@onemoremoose</a> or email me <a href="mailto: hi@imois.in">hi@imois.in</a>.
            </p>

            <h1>Countries & Regions</h1>
            <p> Overall, <b>travle</b> takes a 'more is more' approach to adding regions...</p>

            <h2>Indeterminate & Disputed Territories</h2>
            <p>Travle includes some regions which are indeterminate, or which are disputed or have disputed borders:
            Antarctica, British Indian Ocean Territory, Falkland Islands, Israel, Kosovo, Palestine,
            Siachen Glacier, Western Sahara.</p>


            <p>Travle includes some countries which aren't either aren't recognised by all major regions or have disputed borders. Below is a list of all countries who's status are disputed by 2 or more other regions:</p>
            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="col">Country</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>Åland</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Israel</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Kosovo</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Palestine</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Siachen Glacier</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Somaliland</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Taiwan</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Western Sahara</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            Travle also includes <b>Antarctica</b> and the <b>British Indian Ocean Territory</b>.

            <h2>Remote Territories</h2>

            Travle also splits some countries, especially those with remote territories, into separate regions:

            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="col">Country</th>
                        <th scope="col">Is treated as the following separate regions</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Australian Indian Ocean Territories</td>
                        <td>Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>France</td>
                        <td>France, Mayotte, Réunion, Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Netherlands</td>
                        <td>Netherlands, Caribbean Netherlands</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>New Zealand</td>
                        <td>New Zealand, Tokelau</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Norway</td>
                        <td>Norway, Jan Mayen, Svalbard</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Portugal</td>
                        <td>Madeira, Portugal, Azores</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h2>Map Projection (Why does X look distorted?)</h2>
            <p>
                The Travle map uses a map projection which tries to minimize distortion on visible countries. It is much more accurate than a simple mercator map, or even viewing a globe - especially when there is a small part of the globe visible.
                However, this means countries near the poles may not look how you're used to seeing them on a standard mercator map.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Travle map uses a <b>geoAzimuthalEquidistant</b> map projection, where the center of the projection is the Geo-Centroid of all currently visible countries.
            </p>

            <h2>Country & Region Borders</h2>
            <p>
                Travle uses data from <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a>, who provide the geojson data used both to generate connections and puzzles, as well as in displaying the game.
                The method they use to determine country borders may surprise some: Using the current 'who controls what' information to draw borders.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>
                    "Natural Earth draws boundaries of sovereign states according to de facto (“in fact”) status rather than de
                    jure (“by law”). We show who actually controls the situation on the ground because it turns out laws vary
                    country to country, and countries are only loosely bound by international law in their dealings with each
                    other. While our de facto policy does not please everyone, it is rigorous and self consistent."
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can read more <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/disputed-boundaries-policy/">about their methodology here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This has some impact on disputed regions, for example Western Sahara is only shown to have territory
                to the west of the Berm wall, the east of which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara#Dispute">currently controlled by Morocco</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The exception to this is Ukraine, which retains Crimea despite the current situation.
            </p>

            <h1>Connections</h1>
            <p>
                Travle does not treat each country or region as one singular piece, and requires you to make a joined path from Start to End. These rules were voted on by the community, and are a change from Travle 1.0!
            </p>
            <p>
                The exact rules that cover all cases are:<br>
                <b>Countries</b> and <b>Regions</b> in the game each consist of one or more disjoint <b>Areas</b>.

                You may pass from one <b>Area</b> to another <b>Area</b> either if:
                <ul>
                    <li>(Adjacency): They are adjacent, or a bridge or tunnel connects them OR</li>
                    <li>(Island Hopping): They both belong to the same <b>Country</b> or <b>Region</b> <i>and</i> all points along the shortest line segment which connects them doesn't pass nearer any other <b>Country</b> or <b>Region</b>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    An example of the latter case is <b>Northern Ireland</b> and <b>United Kingdom (Mainland)</b> are two Areas in the <b>United Kingdom</b>.
                    The shortest line between them only passes near the <b>United Kingdom</b>, hence they're connected.
                    A counterexample would be <b>Kaliningrad Oblast</b> does not connect to <b>Russia</b>'s mainland: The line connecting them goes through Lithuania and Latvia too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You Win when you can pass from Start to End through only connected <b>Areas</b> which are within <b>Countries</b> or <b>Regions</b> you've guessed.
                </p>
            </p>

            <p>
                Connections are determined automatically based on adjacent countries from the Natural Earth geojson data. An exhaustive list of examples that affect gameplay are listed below.
            </p>

            <h2>Bridges & Tunnels</h2>

            Travle respects bridges and tunnels which connect countries:

            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="col">Countries</th>
                        <th scope="col">Reason</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>France & United Kingdom</td>
                        <td>Channel Tunnel</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Denmark & Sweden</td>
                        <td>The Øresund Bridge and Drogden Tunnel</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>


            <h2>Island Hopping</h2>

            <p>
                Additionally, Travle allows Island Hopping:
                Jump across (narrow-ish stretches) of water between parts of the same nation, as long as you don't go near any other countries while you do so.
                There are other cases, for example in the south of Chile, which don't create any connections to new countries and are therefore not listed here.
            </p>

            <p>Island hopping is allowed in the following countries or regions:</p>
            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="col">Country</th>
                        <th scope="col">Explanation</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>Croatia</td><td>Southern tip joins with the mainland, hence shares a border w/ Montenegro. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelješac_Bridge">There is also a bridge!</a></td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Indonesia</td><td>Jump between islands</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Malaysia</td><td>Jump between islands</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Turkey</td><td>'Island hopping' over the Bosphorus</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>Northern Ireland connects with the rest of the UK.</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>
                Additionally: Greenland connects to Canada due to their shared ownership of Hans Island.
                Each can Island Hop to Hans Island, which is a surprising land border between the two countries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Island">See here for more information</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                However - Island hopping does not apply to the following countries, which each fail the 'connecting line test':
            </p>

            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="col">Country</th>
                        <th scope="col">Explanation</th>
                    </tr>

            <h1>Puzzles & Puzzle Generation</h1>

            <p>
                Puzzles for <b>travle</b> are autogenerated based on the connections graph.
                This first generates all possible routes between countries and their lengths, then picks
                a sequence of puzzles for the next ~10 years or so according to some rules...
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> No two puzzles in the same week can have the same country as a start point, end point, or as
                    a point on any shortest solution (often there are multiple 'shortest' paths or solutions for any given travle).</li>
                <li>The lengths are pseudo-randomized to give a good distribution of puzzle lengths.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The distribution of puzzle lengths for v2.0 is much more random. You can see the distribution of the next 1000
                puzzles' lengths shown below.
            </p>

            <h2>Guess Count</h2>
            <p>The number of guesses for a Travle is based on the length of the shortest path.</p>

            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="col"># Guesses in Shortest Solution</th>
                        <th scope="col"># Extra Guesses</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>2-3</td><td>4</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>4-6</td><td>5</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>7-9</td><td>6</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>10-12</td><td>7</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>13+</td><td>8</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>For example, if the shortest path between two countries requires 6 guesses, the game will give you up to 6+5 = 11 guesses.</p>

            <h2>Puzzle Scoring</h2>

            <p>
                There is always a minimum number of guesses you are from completing a travle. This is what travle uses to determine guess 'quality', and which emoji to give to each guess.
            </p>
            <p>If you make a guess which decreases that number, the guess is marked ✅.</p>
            <p>
                For example, to go from <b>Spain</b> to <b>Austria</b> you can go to <b>France</b>, then via any of <b>Germany</b>, <b>Switzerland</b> or <b>Italy</b>. You're 2 guesses from
                the answer. If your first guess is <b>Germany</b>, you're now one guess from the answer - so <b>Germany</b> is marked ✅. If you then guess <b>Italy</b> - even
                though that country was on the shortest path <i>to begin with</i>, you're still one guess away. Italy doesn't help you now, so it's
                marked 🟧 instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                🟧 means the path through the newly guessed country is a similar length to the shortest. In the previous example, after guessing
                <b>Germany</b> and <b>Italy</b>, the shortest path is 1 guess. The shortest path which passes through <b>Italy</b> also only requires one additional guess.
                Hence, it is marked orange. The rule allows a leeway of 1 extra guess too, so even <b>Slovakia</b> would still be marked 🟧 - the path via <b>Slovakia</b>
                requires 2 additional guesses: <b>France</b> and <b>Poland</b>, which is just 1 more than the shortest path - which only requires <b>France</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                🟥 means the path through the newly guessed country is longer than the requirement above.
            </p>
            <p>
                ⬛ means there is no path through the newly guessed country. This also means there is no path from the start or end point to the guessed country.
            </p>
