FAQ


Do exclaves count? E.g. Kaliningrad Oblast, Ceuta or Melilla..?

No! Travle requires you to name every country you pass through when going from A to B. This means Poland -> Russia -> China isn't a valid connection, as you can't teleport from Kaliningrad Oblast to mainland Russia.

Travle also allows short, direct hops over water.
A full list of special cases is available here.
