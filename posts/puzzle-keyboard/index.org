* The TL;DR
- The puzzle keyboard can be used as a *60% normal layout* keyboard as well as a *split* keyboard.
- It's designed to be lazer-cut in layered acrylic cheaply - no need for expensive metal plates, PCBs or other custom metal hardware.
- Controversial: The 'b' key is on the opposite side! I've always hit that with my right hand, and I'm not going to start now...
- No wasted _space_ in the bottom row (pun intended, apologies). Lots of room for modifiers.
- Hand wired so I can admire the pretty wire patterns while trying to avoid looking closely at the results my poor soldering skills.
