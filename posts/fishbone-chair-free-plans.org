Back in 2013 I designed and made this chair! It's a fishbone chair - quite the trend of the time, but there weren't any good designs available online. The chair can be cnc-milled out of a single standard sheet of 3/4" 8'x4' mdf or plywood, and slots together with no fastners or glue!

We've been using the chair for the past 8 years, and isn't showing any signs of wear. Admittedly, it's comfier with some cushions.

I designed it in blender, taking a rough chair model and cutting slices into it. There are 16 slices making up the main seat, with 2 more providing support along the length of the chair.

While I'm sure it's possible to cut this out by hand, it's much easier to do it via CNC. I was able to find a local shop that cut it out for me, and this is the design I gave them. Just keep track of which piece is which! Once they get mixed up, it's hard to sort them out. Then... The whole piece fits together like a big sawdusty puzzle.
