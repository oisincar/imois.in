*** Refactor

  - [ ] Set current hint ix, callback for enable hint.

- [ ] Some saving things class, can be configured for endless mode.

*** Endless mode
What should it do?

- Keep playing...
- Shows how long your current streak is.

- Results page w/ info on all routes you did..?

- Keep track of longest streak (run). Maybe possible to re-use some of the current results UI.

- No hints?
- Saves current route and progress.
- Maybe fewer guesses? (not for now)


*** Gameplay:
- [ ] Add 'hard mode' option to hide countries (or country names)

- [X] HINTS:

  - [X] Reveal country outlines
  - [X] First letters of countries (after clicking on them?)

  - [ ] Just... It's kinda ugly? Improve layout?

  - I guess show them, but don't zoom the map to fit them in?


*** New Travles

** Bonus
- [ ] Separate out country graph & algorithms(?)
- [ ] Multilingual support
- [ ] Make the path shown in the end screen also use the smallest countries
- [ ] Clarify in the end screen that the paths shown are only one of several possible paths.
