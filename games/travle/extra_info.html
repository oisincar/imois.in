            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                For <b>travle</b> 2.0 I decided to try to be much more transparent about how the game works.
                This page provides some in-depth information about the various countries, borders, connections and rules that govern <b>travle</b>.
                I don't expect the decisions here to please everyone, but I hope there is at least some consistant logic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course there will also be mistakes and bugs! And really, my knowledge of geopolitics isn't strong enough to have opinions on lots of these issues.
                I'm always happy to be corrected and/or informed - you can find me on Twitter
                <a href="https://twitter.com/onemoremoose">@onemoremoose</a> or email me <a href="mailto: hi@imois.in">hi@imois.in</a>.
            </p>

            <h1>Countries & Regions</h1>
            <p> Overall, <b>travle</b> takes a 'more is more' approach to adding regions...</p>

            <h2>Indeterminate & Disputed Territories</h2>
            <p>Travle includes some regions which are indeterminate, or which are disputed or have disputed borders:
            Antarctica, British Indian Ocean Territory, Falkland Islands, Israel, Kosovo, Palestine,
            Siachen Glacier, Western Sahara.</p>

            <h2>Remote Territories</h2>

            Travle also splits some countries, especially those with remote territories, into separate regions:

            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="col">Country</th>
                        <th scope="col">Is treated as the following separate regions</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>France</td>
                        <td>France, Mayotte, Réunion, Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Australian Indian Ocean Territories</td>
                        <td>Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Netherlands</td>
                        <td>Netherlands, Caribbean Netherlands</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Norway</td>
                        <td>Norway, Jan Mayen, Svalbard</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>New Zealand</td>
                        <td>New Zealand, Tokelau</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Portugal</td>
                        <td>Madeira, Portugal, Azores</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h2>Country & Region Borders</h2>
            <p>
                Travle uses data from <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a>, who provide the geojson data used both to generate connections and puzzles, as well as in displaying the game.
                The method they use to determine country borders may surprise some: Using the current 'who controls what' information to draw borders.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>
                    "Natural Earth draws boundaries of sovereign states according to de facto (“in fact”) status rather than de
                    jure (“by law”). We show who actually controls the situation on the ground because it turns out laws vary
                    country to country, and countries are only loosely bound by international law in their dealings with each
                    other. While our de facto policy does not please everyone, it is rigorous and self consistent."
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can read more <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/disputed-boundaries-policy/">about their methodology here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This has some impact on disputed regions, for example Western Sahara is only shown to have territory
                to the west of the Berm wall, the east of which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara#Dispute">currently controlled by Morocco</a>.
                The exception to this is Ukraine, which retains Crimea despite the current situation.
            </p>

            <h1>Connections</h1>
            <p>
                Travle's ruleset demands that players create a path from start to end that they could walk along without entering another country or the sea.
                In special cases, to allow the inclusion of countries like Indonesia, an extra rule <i>'Island Hopping'</i> allows players to jump between the various islands that make it up. More info below.
            </p>
            <p>
                Connections are determined automatically based on adjacent countries from the Natural Earth geojson data, then tweaked manually according to the following rules.
            </p>

            <h2>Bridges & Tunnels</h2>

            Travle respects bridges and tunnels which connect countries:

            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="col">Countries</th>
                        <th scope="col">Reason</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>France & United Kingdom</td>
                        <td>Channel Tunnel</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Denmark & Sweden</td>
                        <td>The Øresund Bridge and Drogden Tunnel</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>


            <h2>Island Hopping</h2>

            <p>
                Additionally, Travle allows Island Hopping:
                Jump across (narrow-ish stretches) of water between parts of the same nation.
            </p>

            <p>
                This section gives an exhaustive list of examples that affect gameplay. There are others, for example in the south of Chile, which don't create any new connections and are therefore not listed here.
            </p>

            <p>Island hopping is allowed in the following countries or regions:</p>
            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="col">Country</th>
                        <th scope="col">Explanation</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>Croatia</td><td>Southern tip joins with the mainland, hence shares a border w/ Montenegro</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Indonesia</td><td>Jump between islands</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Malaysia</td><td>Jump between islands</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Turkey</td><td>'Island hopping' over the Bosphorus</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>Northern Ireland connects with the rest of the UK.</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>
                Additionally: Greenland connects to Canada due to their shared ownership of Hans Island.
                Each can Island Hop to Hans Island, which is a surprising land border between the two countries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Island">See here for more information</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                However - Island hopping does not apply to the following countries, which contain a disjoint part:
            </p>

            <table class="table">

                    <tr>
                        <th scope="col">Country</th>
                        <th scope="col">Explanation</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>Angola</td><td>North-east part is disjoint. Angola therefore doesn't connect Congo to Namibia.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Azerbaijan</td><td>South west is disjoint, Azerbaijan therefore doesn't connect Turkey to Russia.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Palestine</td><td>Gaza Strip not considered connected to West Bank</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Russia</td><td>Kaliningrad is disjoint. Russia doesn't connect e.g. Poland to [anything mainland russia touches]</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Spain</td><td>Mainland Spain does not connect to Morocco via Ceuta or Melilla</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h1>Puzzles & Puzzle Generation</h1>

            <p>
                Puzzles for <b>travle</b> are autogenerated based on the connections graph.
                This first generates all possible routes between countries and their lengths, then picks
                a sequence of puzzles for the next ~10 years or so according to some rules...
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> No two puzzles in the same week can have the same country as a start point, end point, or as
                    a point on any shortest solution (often there are multiple 'shortest' paths or solutions for any given travle).</li>
                <li>The lengths are pseudo-randomized to give a good distribution of puzzle lengths.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The distribution of puzzle lengths for v2.0 is much more random. You can see the distribution of the next 1000
                puzzles' lengths shown below.
            </p>

            <p>For example, if the shortest path between two countries requires 6 guesses, the game will give you up to 6+4 = 10 guesses.</p>

            <h2>Puzzle Scoring</h2>

            <p>
                There is always a minimum number of guesses you are from completing a travle. This is what travle uses to determine guess 'quality', and which emoji to give to each guess.
            </p>
            <p>If you make a guess which decreases that number, the guess is marked ✅.</p>
            <p>
                For example, to go from <b>Spain</b> to <b>Austria</b> you can go to <b>France</b>, then via any of <b>Germany</b>, <b>Switzerland</b> or <b>Italy</b>. You're 2 guesses from
                the answer. If your first guess is <b>Germany</b>, you're now one guess from the answer - so <b>Germany</b> is marked ✅. If you then guess <b>Italy</b> - even
                though that country was on the shortest path <i>to begin with</i>, you're still one guess away. Italy doesn't help you now, so it's
                marked 🟧 instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                🟧 means the path through the newly guessed country is a similar length to the shortest. In the previous example, after guessing
                <b>Germany</b> and <b>Italy</b>, the shortest path is 1 guess. The shortest path which passes through <b>Italy</b> also only requires one additional guess.
                Hence, it is marked orange. The rule allows a leeway of 1 extra guess too, so even <b>Slovakia</b> would still be marked 🟧 - the path via <b>Slovakia</b>
                requires 2 additional guesses: <b>France</b> and <b>Poland</b>, which is just 1 more than the shortest path - which only requires <b>France</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                🟥 means the path through the newly guessed country is longer than the requirement above.
            </p>
            <p>
                ⬛ means there is no path through the newly guessed country. This also means there is no path from the start or end point to the guessed country.
